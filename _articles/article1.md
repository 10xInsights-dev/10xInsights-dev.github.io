This is the intro article for 10xInsights. 

More of a meta post than anything else.

Contributing isn't hard at all. Though now doubt there will be some nevous to do so.
It's hard putting your thoughts out into the world and having them critiqued by others. But it's worth it.

As a contributor there are many and varied  ways to help. We've outlined below what we're looking for. You can start small and work up!
If you propose and idea and it doesn't fit then we'll suggest either an alternative way to contribute or try to find someone who might want to take it on instead.

What we'd like to offer is a safe space to post some written content as well as an oppotunity to be on the podcast. Not everyone will want that and we probably cant give airtime to every candidate.
But if you have something to say and would like to share it here then please do!

If you're not sure ask - wer'e on **linkedIn**, **twitter** and **bluesky** or you can email **editor@10xinsights.dev**
