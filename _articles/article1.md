Public speaking isn't hard at all if you know your subject and you're talking to friends.

We know it can be hard putting your thoughts out into the world and having them critiqued by others but in this case we already know you're a world expert and , hey, we're a friendly ear.


World Expert?  yes! no-one has had your experiences.  Your career path.  Sure there are others that have the same job title but only you did it your way. You're the world expert on you so why not talk with us about what you learnt and what you think others might benefit from. Good stories, or cautionary tales we'd like them all.


Contributing your knowledge and career advice to the community will help someone else pick a better path. Wether just a different step or a giant leap, you can help others in that quest we're all on - how to be the best professional we can be.

What we'd like to offer is a safe space to talk about subjects you care about and potentially answer some career questions.

If you're not sure ask - we're on **linkedIn**, **twitter** and **bluesky** or you can email **editor@10xinsights.dev**
